# Utopian Moderation Guidelines

These guidelines aim to familiarise new and current moderators with the review process and specific criteria for each category on [Utopian](https://utopian.io). They also provide useful checklists for your everyday moderation work.

**Remember that these documents are still in progress!**

## General Moderation Workflow

Utopian moderators and community managers can find all information about the moderation workflow in [here](general.md).

## Categories

Utopian is open to many kinds of contributions. We will present to you the current list of categories in which the contributions can be divided. The list is also crucial for the submissions to include the right tags so that Utopian tools can fetch them and regularly reviewed.

The first tag must be **utopian-io**. Utopian also utilises the second tag for categorising submissions into the right categories, regardless of being a contribution or a task request. You can see the category specific tags below.

Each of the categories has its own, more detailed guidelines in a separate document.

### Contributions

| Category | Tag |
|-|-|
| [Analysis](categories/analysis.md) | analysis |
| [Blog](categories/blog.md) | blog |
| [Bug Hunting](categories/bug-hunting.md) | bug-hunting |
| [Copywriting](categories/copywriting.md) | copywriting |
| [Development](categories/development.md) | development |
| [Documentation](categories/documentation.md) | documentation |
| [Graphics](categories/graphics.md) | graphics |
| [Suggestions](categories/suggestions.md) | ideas |
| [Translations](categories/translations.md) | translations |
| [Tutorials](categories/tutorials.md) | tutorials |
| [Video Tutorials](categories/video-tutorials.md) | video-tutorials |
| [Visibility](categories/visibility.md) | social |

Missing or misplaced tags may cause that the fetching script does not see the post. Always check the tags and if it is missing or the author used a wrong tag, ask them to change it. If the script did not fetch it, notify a Community Manager so that they can add the post manually.

Note that the translation category is outsourced to [DaVinci group][dv-discord] and is not sufficiently maintained by Utopian.

### Task Requests

Moreover, Utopian has created a section for project owners to look for contributors and colleagues. We named it Task Requests, and it is suitable for anyone with an existing open source project which welcomes help from other people.

Note that not all categories have their counterpart in task requests. That does not mean that they could not cooperate, in any case.

Tags that are used for task requests are similar to contributions with a minor difference. The tags include a prefix **task-**.

| Category | Tag |
|-|-|
| Analysis | task-analysis |
| Blog | --- |
| Bug Hunting | task-bug-hunting |
| Copywriting | task-copywriting |
| Development | task-development |
| Documentation | task-documentation |
| Graphics | task-graphics |
| Suggestions | --- |
| Translations | --- |
| Tutorials | --- |
| Video Tutorials | --- |
| Visibility | task-social |
