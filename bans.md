# Utopian Account Suspension Policy

## Introduction

This document details the various instances of user violation of the Utopian ToS and/or policies. To ensure fairness and consistency, the duration of the suspension period must be in accordance to the guidelines in this document.

The terms used in this document to define the penalty on a per-case basis:

- Offense - the policy violated by an user;
- Duration - duration, in days, during which the offense was committed;
- Strikes - a number of times the offense is repeated. The strikes are reset when the user is banned for said offense or after a cooling period of 90 days. Strikes marked in bold, refer to the total number of strikes. These do not reset on suspension and do not time out.

Ex.: If an offense is punishable after 3 Strikes, the third time the user fails to adhere to the guidelines and policies, his account will be suspended.

## Disclaimer

Utopian reserves all the rights to suspend an account for shorter/longer durations depending on case-to-case basis, as well as the right to suspend an account for an offense not present in the document below if it is clear that the offense is against the Utopian spirit.
