### Moderating Blog Posts

This guide is to inform moderators about the reviewing process of [Blog Posts](https://utopian.io/blog/review) category. 

**Reminder**: Please, see [Utopian Rules](https://utopian.io/rules) to learn about the upto-date rules first. 


#### Formatting and Content Problems 

Blog posts category is a category that where we need **good looking** posts.

- The images inside the contribution should be looking good and have sources cited. Authors should avoid using low quality screenshots, irrelevant images, repetitive images.

- The contribution should have a good structure, so the readers don't get headaches to read it.

- Posts should not end up with a *"join my team, vote for my witness campaign, resteem and win!"* kind of things. This is a general rule but most authors on this category tend to do that.

- Abusive **BIG BOLD TEXT USAGE** is not allowed. You may ask author to fix those.

- Introductionary, wiki-style descriptive posts are not encouraged. We expect detailed overviews, experiences about open-source projects. Blog posts should add more value into the platform than a standard wiki page. 

- A contribution with tons of typos should not be accepted. We expect good authoring skills.

- Blog posts formatted with *"X thing for Y purpose"* (buzzfeed style) should be only accepted if the post gives **detailed** content on each listed open-source project/application. 


### Red Flags (Instant Hide)

- Even though we have accepted blog posts in local languages in the past, We don't accept them anymore. All blog posts must be in English.

- Rules clearly state that, blog posts must be directly related to a open-source project. Ranting about general open-source movement is a red flag with the current rule set and shouldn't get an approve.

### Category changes

Some authors tend to post some tutorials in the blog posts category. It's impossible to move posts from blog posts to tutorials at the moment, so these will be instant hides with an explanation.

You can advise authors to re-create contribution on the related category. However, if the contribution has basic mistakes, you should also warn them about the problems.

### Things to consider

This category is open to plagiarism attacks. Even we saw **"rephrase plagiarism"** in this category. Use the plagiarism checker tools, google search to detect these kind of behaviour.

### Comment Templates

1. For the posts not related to open source. Ex: personal blogging.

```
