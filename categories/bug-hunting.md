# Moderating Bug Hunting Contributions

**Reminder:** Please read the current [Utopian Rules](https://utopian.io/rules) first, to bring yourself up to date.

The [Bug Hunting](https://utopian.io/bug-hunting/review) category is very formal and follows strict rules. Bug reports need to describe the issue in a detailed but precise way. Irrelevant information should be avoided. Less is more in this category!

## What is a Bug?

It's important at this point, to give a clear definition of what Utopian considers as a bug and what not.

Bugs are unintended behaviors, that lead to malfunction and/or vulnerabilities. Layout issues, e.g. those related to responsive web design, that do not break the functionality of the website/app, can't be accepted as valid bug reports.

Also sometimes the actual intended behavior is mistaken for a bug, due to a lack of understanding of the software.

As a moderator you have to competently judge what is an actual bug and what not.

## Format

Bug reports should be as streamlined as possible to make it as easy as possible to review them, not only for the moderators but first of all for the developers dealing with those bugs. Irrelevant information, such as personal stories, unrelated links, images or video parts, should be avoided.

> **Relevant information:**
> 
> *When executing the `run` command, my computer freezes.*

> **Irrelevant information:**
>
> *I use this app everyday for years now and I am really very happy with it. Today I want to show you something I discovered in the App and I think it is a bug.*

A bug report needs to provide the following information (only):

- a short but appropriate description of the bug
- an appropriate demonstration of the bug (screenshot, gif, video)
- version numbers of used software (browser, operating system, drivers, etc.)

The only exception for additional information is a suggested solution to the problem.

A GIF or a video is not always necessary. In many cases a simple screenshot is enough and sometimes even a screenshot can't help to explain a bug better than the description does.
However, as soon as there's visual content included, it should contain only the minimal information and not leak personal or other irrelevant information.

### Issues on GitHub

If the contributor is connected to GitHub, Utopian automatically posts approved bug reports in the repository's issue tracker. This is why it is so important to ensure the quality and correctness of each contribution. Many project owners will have their first contact with Utopian in their issue tracker on GitHub.

If the user files an issue on GitHub before the contribution on Utopian is approved, there will be a duplicate. In this case it's recommended to leave a comment below the issue with a link to the original issue that was created by the user. The user should be cleared up about this.
