# Moderating Translation Contributions

**Reminder:** Please read the current [Utopian Rules](https://utopian.io/rules) first, to bring yourself up to date. This file might not be up to date. It was last updated on *12 Jan 2018*.

The [Translation](https://utopian.io/translation/review) category has historically been the most popular category on utopian-io. Because of that, the quality of the translation is the leading factor in the evaluation of contributions. The contributions must be submitted on [crowdin.com](https://crowdin.com) or [github.com](https://github.com), and in case of github, must be submitted as a pull request and merged into the repository before they can be accepted. As a moderator of this category, you'll need to be fluent in English and flawless in your mother tongue. Any translations that aren't close to perfection aren't welcome on utopian.

Ideally, a translation contribution should always be reviewed by a moderator that can understand the submitted language and find mistakes in the translation. If that's not possible, posts are to be reviewed by using various translators and by comparing the contribution to results of machine translation. If the results match, the post shall be rejected.

## Rules:

* This category is meant only for translations you have updated or created for an Open Source project.
>Just as everything on utopian, translations will only be accepted for active open source projects. The project must have been updated in the last year (and not a single day more) via a commit or a merged pull request.

* Minimum 1000 words per translation contribution. Text that is supposed to remain untranslated (links, code, paths, ...) or duplicated strings/text can't be included in the minimum amount of words.
>This rule is to be enforced without any exception. The moderators are expected to check how much of the translation is real text, compared to code and repeated strings. Anything that isn't real text shall not be counted towards this minimum word count.

* Proofread or merged translations are always preferred. Submitting translations that are not proofread will lead to a lower vote.
>This is to be filled in in a questionnaire when accepting your post. 

* You could translate less than the minimum amount of words if the project itself has less to be translated in total. May lead to a lower vote.
>This only applies to projects which have less than the minimum words total. If a single file of the project has less than the miminum words, the contributor is expected to start working on an another file. If the project was almost fully translated and there's less than the minimum words left, but the project has more than the minimum words total, the contribution shall not be accepted, except in edge cases that should be discussed with your supervisor.

* The contribution will be rejected if the submitted translation is older than 7 days since the submitted contribution.
>This rule is to be enforced without any exception. This is a subject to change due to how proofreading works.

* If it is obvious that you can't properly write in the source language of the translation, your contribution will be rejected.
>A big ammount of errors and/or obvious gramaticall errors will always result in an instant rejection of a post.

* Only translations on CrowdIn or Github are accepted. You should not translate the words and provide them in your Utopian post directly.
>Any translation submited to an another website should be permamently hidden on sight, while informing the contributor about this rule and allowing him to contribute again with this rule in mind.

* Your Github Account or Crowdin Account must match your Steem/Utopian account. If it does not you must use the field "Full Name" in Crowdin to show you are the author.
>Just as with GitHub in the [Development](https://utopian.io/development/review) or [Documentation](https://utopian.io/documentation/review) categories, proof of identity is required before the post can be accepted. If there's any suspicion of plagiarism, report the post to your supervisor immediately.

* You must include every possible detail to check the translations and the tools you have used to translate.
>Machine-Translations (MT) that lead to incorrect translations are a reason to reject the post on sight. If enough details to evaluate the ammount of work are not provided, the post shall also be rejected.

* Entire translations are always preferred. If you are writing about a partial translation we reserve the right to evaluate the actual work.
>If the user is splitting his posts into convinient 1000 word parts, you may use the quality slider to lower their vote.

* Same translations from different authors will be accepted if the moderator can recognise the newest translation has better quality.
>The quality of new translations has to be significantly better for this rule to be enforced. 

* If the provided translation is obviously machine-translated for more than its 20% or has low quality will be rejected.
>Users continuously breaking this rule should be reported to your supervisor immediately. If the post is machine-translated using crowdin's build in translation tools, it may be accepted as long as the translations are 100% correct and are not a majority of all translations made.

* Proof-reading is not acceptable in Utopian as a valid contribution.

### Post Formatting

All contributions submitted to Utopian, including translations, **must be formal** and informative. Every contribution in the [Translation](https://utopian.io/translation/review) category must include:

* Formal language.
* A short description of the project.
* An information on how much progress was achieved by the contribution (at least the ammount of words).
* Screeshots with proof of work.
* A short description of the translation process.
* The link to the Github repository.
* The link to contributor's Crowdin profile or his activity.
* The link to project's Crowdin page.

Any contribution that's lacking in one, or more, of these points shall not be accepted on utopian. 

On top of that, every contribution in the [Translation](https://utopian.io/translation/review) category must **NOT** include:

* Anything unrelated to the project or the translation process.
* Badly formatted text. 
* Any sort of advertisement, ex. *"Resteem and upvote me!"*

### Machine-Translations

The biggest issue of this category is currently how many machine-translations are being submitted. If an obviously machine-translated is spotted, it is to be hidden immediatelly and reported to a supervisor. If the user has already been unlocked by a supervisor and he continues to contribute machine-translated translations, he's to be reported to the supervisors again to be permamently banned off the site. 

This is extremely important, as Utopian can't gain the trust of project owners as long as machine translators are getting through. If you have any suspicion that the contributor does not speak a language he's translating to, feel free to interview him and only allow his post once he's proven his competence in that language.

## Notes

* A lot of the points here are based on the fact that the *quality slider* is coming to utopian soon. If it doens't come soon enough, this file will be updated to reflect the current state of Utopian.
