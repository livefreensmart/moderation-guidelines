### Moderating Blog Posts

This guide is to inform moderators about the reviewing process of [Blog Posts](https://utopian.io/blog/review) category. 

**Reminder**: Please, see [Utopian Rules](https://utopian.io/rules) to learn about the upto-date rules first. 


#### Formatting and Content Problems 

Blog posts category is a category that where we need **good looking** posts.

- The images inside the contribution should be looking good and have sources cited. Authors should avoid using low quality screenshots, irrelevant images, repetitive images.

- The contribution should have a good structure, so the readers don't get headaches to read it.

- Posts should not end up with a *"join my team, vote for my witness campaign, resteem and win!"* kind of things. This is a general rule but most authors on this category tend to do that.

- Abusive **BIG BOLD TEXT USAGE** is not allowed. You may ask author to fix those.

- Introductionary, wiki-style descriptive posts are not encouraged. We expect detailed overviews, experiences about open-source projects. Blog posts should add more value into the platform than a standard wiki page. 

- A contribution with tons of typos should not be accepted. We expect good authoring skills.

- Blog posts formatted with *"X thing for Y purpose"* (buzzfeed style) should be only accepted if the post gives **detailed** content on each listed open-source project/application. 


### Red Flags (Instant Hide)

- Rules clearly state that, blog posts must be directly related to a open-source project. Ranting about general open-source movement is a red flag with the current rule set and shouldn't get an approve.

- Even though we have accepted blog posts in local languages in the past, We don't accept them anymore. All blog posts must be in English.

### Things to consider

This category is open to plagiarism attacks. Even we saw **"rephrase plagiarism"** in this category. Use the plagiarism checker tools, google search to detect these kind of behaviour.

### Comment Templates

1. For the posts not related to open source. Ex: personal blogging.

```
