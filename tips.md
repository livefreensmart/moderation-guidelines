# Utopian Tip Guideline

## What is Utopian Tip?

Utopian came up with the concept of tipping post comments with two purposes in mind:

- Providing extra income to moderators. While moderators earn points (and SBD) for their work, Utopian Tip came as an additional incentive for moderators to go the extra mile and write high quality comment to the post author, to earn an extra “tip”.
- Enticing community engagement. In order to get more interaction from the community on utopian posts, we decided to open Utopian tip to all the community, so that any member would be able to receive a tip for a well written feedback on a post.

Utopian tip is normally cast using a tool located at <https://tip.utopian.io> whereby users with proper permission will be able to login, provide a comment url, and tip it! The tip value is at 1% VP of *utopian-io* account. At the time of writing this amounts to around 3+ SBD upvote, and varies according to STEEM/SBD price fluctuations.

While only accessible to certain accounts, we recently introduced an additional feature which is a Mega tip, under the shape of a checkbox via that same tool above, and allows providing a much larger tip at 3% VP of the *utopian-io* account.

## When to cast a tip?

Based on the definition and purpose above, sending out a utopian tip needs to follow certain guidelines to properly incentivize both moderators and community members. Below is our vision into that:

- **Content**: A comment worthy of tipping must provide a **good review of several aspects** of the post. Whether **positive or negative**, they must be properly addressed and to relate directly to the content of the post. Added value content would include asking additional **thought-provoking or challenging questions** relating to the content.
- **Length**: A comment that is less than 3 sentences would rarely deserve a tip, as it wouldn’t contain enough information or suggestions pertaining the relevant post.
- **Repetitiveness**: Repetitive content that has been already mentioned by a moderator or another comment may not be eligible for a tip. Similarly comments that are just used as standard or copy-paste, particularly by moderators, are not eligible for tipping.
- **Capturing Plagiarism**: This is where the mega tip comes in. We want to get some help from the community in finding plagiarism, as unfortunately this is more common than we would like it to be. And hence this would bring a higher value and assistance to Utopian in preventing abuse. When an author (or even a moderator) finds a **clear and well-researched** plagiarism attempt, this might be well-worth receiving a mega tip.
